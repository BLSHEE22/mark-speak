Blacked out again down in Mexico \n
Jose Cuervo got me again \n
Wasted again with El Diablo \n
Alcohol my only friend \n
Smash the bottles on the reef \n
Wash the dirt off of my feet \n
That was the summer of my life \n
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was \n 
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us \n
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
I fell in love down in Mexico \n
She took me for everything I had \n
Woke up in jail in Rosarito, federales took it all \n
I'm out of cash about to crash \n
Smash the bottles on the reef \n
Wash the dirt off of my feet \n
That was the summer of my life \n
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was \n
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us \n
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was \n
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us \n
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon \n
Now I'm drinking by myself \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face \n
