Deep in your heart there was once a diamond shining bright \n
Every dark place you passed by turned into light \n 
But somebody broke into your heart and blew out your lights \n
And your sparkling little diamond turned pale overnight \n
What the hell has become of that pretty girl so sweet and nice \n
Where have remaind your insatiable thirst after life \n
Girl what ever they have done to you, where ever you are \n
No ever so big force on earth could kill a burning hearts \n \n 

Shine on, shine on \n
Don't let the bastards drag you down \n
Shine on, like a torch burns in a storm \n
Shine on and on, and keep the fire burnings \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n

Your train ran off the rails, hey girl you didn't lay the tracks \n
If you wanna reach for the sky you have to go through hell and back \n
Don't deliver girl, let me take you by the hand \n
At the end of the rainbow the way of cross still ends \n
Shine on, shine on \n
Don't let the bastards drag you down \n
Shine on, like a torch burns in a storm \n
Shine on and on, and keep the fire burnings \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n

Shine on, shine on, shine on \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n
Don't let the bastards drag you down \n
Shine on, shine on \n
Don't let the bastards drag you down \n
Shine on, like a torch burns in a storm \n
Shine on and on, and keep the fire burnings \n
Shine on, shine on, shine on \n

Shine on, shine on, shine on \n
Don't let the bastards drag you down \n
