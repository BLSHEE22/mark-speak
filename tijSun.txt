Blacked out again down in Mexico
Jose Cuervo got me again
Wasted again with El Diablo
Alcohol my only friend
Smash the bottles on the reef
Wash the dirt off of my feet
That was the summer of my life
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
I fell in love down in Mexico
She took me for everything I had
Woke up in jail in Rosarito, federales took it all
I'm out of cash about to crash
Smash the bottles on the reef
Wash the dirt off of my feet
That was the summer of my life
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
I've been drinking to forget just how good it was
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
I've been drinking to forget bout the both of us
I was drinking with you, then I'm drinking till noon
Now I'm drinking by myself
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
Tijuana sunrise shine upon my face
